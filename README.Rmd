This is an R package to install all dependencies to test the bleeding edge of all relevant packages to the Shiny team.

For more direct usage examples, see [`rstudio/shinycoreci-apps`](https://github.com/rstudio/shinycoreci-apps).


## Installation

Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("rstudio/shinycoreci")
```

These `Remotes` will be installed to make sure the latest package development is working as expected:

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
pkgs <-
  sort(
    strsplit(
      desc::desc_get_field("Remotes"),
      "\\n\\s*"
    )[[1]]
  )

# remove branches, sha, and commas
pkgs <- sub("[, (@#].*$", "", pkgs)

# print as links to repos
cat(
  paste0(
    "* [", pkgs, "](http://github.com/", pkgs, ")",
    collapse = "\n"
  )
)
```
